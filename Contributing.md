# 🤝 Contributing Guide

This repository is a **personal learning log and systems-level exploration of Node.js**. Contributions are welcome **only if they align with the philosophy below**.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy First

Before contributing, understand the core principles:

- ❌ No frameworks (Express, Nest, Fastify, etc.)
- ❌ No unnecessary third-party NPM packages
- ✅ Node.js **core modules only**
- ✅ Internals over abstractions
- ✅ Performance-aware code
- ✅ Curiosity-driven experiments

If your contribution hides complexity instead of explaining it, it does **not** belong here.

---

## 📦 What Can Be Contributed

You may contribute:

- Deep explanations of Node.js core modules
- Experiments demonstrating runtime behavior
- Performance benchmarks
- OS / networking concepts related to Node
- Minimal, focused code examples
- Bug fixes or clarifications in notes

---

## 🚫 What Should NOT Be Contributed

- Framework-based examples
- Copy-pasted tutorials
- Shallow explanations
- Style-focused refactors without learning value
- "Hello world"-level content

---

## 🧪 Contribution Structure

Each contribution should include:

1. **Why this exists**
2. **What problem it solves**
3. **How Node.js implements it internally**
4. **Experiments or observations**
5. **Performance or design notes (if applicable)**

---

## 📝 Writing Style

- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Use diagrams and pseudo-code where helpful
- Assume the reader is technical but curious
- Avoid hand-wavy explanations

---

## 🧠 Mindset

This repository values **understanding over speed**.

Take your time. Break things. Measure things. Explain things.

Happy hacking 🚀
